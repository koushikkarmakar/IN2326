## Bonus Project 2

The second bonus project is about analyzing taxi rides in New York with Apache Spark. For a description of the exact task, please see the attached PDF file.

Please find source code in this repository: https://gitlab.db.in.tum.de/kersten/fde18-bonusproject2 . Fork this project if you want to work on the task.

As a first step, please set the visibility to private. Go to Settings -> Permissions and set Project visibility to Private. If you don't do this, everyone can see your implementation and use your tricks.
As a second step, please set your teamname and realname in team.txt. The teamname is used in a public leaderboard, realname will be hidden and only used to provide the bonus.

Submission

The repository is set up so that every commit that is pushed to gitlab is picked up by gitlabs continuous integration system. It will first run tests. If tests pass, a performance evaluations stage is started. The timing result of this stage is submitted to contest.db.in.tum.de. All submissions which occurred in this way and execute in less than 10 minutes will be considered for the bonus. You are welcome to submit early and often. The runtime in the leaderboard will be the minimum runtime of all your submissions.

Deadline

11.1.19 23:59

All submissions before this date will be considered for the bonus.

Bonus System

There will be three projects, set up similarly to this one. If you complete all of them, you will receive a grade bonus of 0.3 on you final exam grade.

The workload for these tasks is not very high. So I ask you to work on these projects alone. There will be no teams of multiple people allowed for submission. However, you are welcome to discuss your solutions and approaches.
